/ TAB CLOAK METHOD \

How to cloak / disguise your window tabs
: Open your browser and press CTRL+SHIFT+O at the same time
: Now click the three dots on the far right and click "Add new bookmark" 
: Now copy and paste the javascript code from below and set it as the URL
: Don't worry about the name you can set it to whatever
: Now open a tab you want to disguise and click the bookmark
: Enter the title you want for the tab (so if I want to cloak it as clever I would put "Clever | Portal")
: Then enter the number of which icon you want to use (if I was cloaking my tab as google search I would enter 2)
: Now your tab should be disguised, note this won't show on go-guardian it only has a visual effect
