/ Q/A \

'What is a proxy?'
Proxy servers work by facilitating web requests and responses between a user and a web server. The way this works is you give the website a URL for example google.com. The website then will embed the URL in the display page so you may view the site without actually leaving the original website. (If this is confusing just look it up on google lol)
__

'What is a DNS?'
Smart DNS and VPN services both unblock geo-restricted websites and stream video content from abroad. However, only a VPN hides your IP address and encrypts your web traffic. Custom DNS doesn't spoof your location or encrypt your data transfers, but it can improve your internet speeds and security

'How will I be able to know when a new site is added / new method is added?'
Just go back to the domain, https://vacapena.ga and you will be redirected to the original Pastebin with all the updated sites, methods, and exploits
__

'Who made this?'
It's a secret, nobody will ever really know I guess ðŸ¤”

â€˜What is mainframe?â€™

MainFrame is a project Iâ€™ve created to help you bypass all restrictions on school chromebooks.
__

â€˜What can I bypass with MainFrame?â€™

MainFrame can disable any sort of spy ware that can view what your doing on your chromebook, this includes GoGurdian, OneTrust, ClassDojo, LanSchool, and DyKnowClassroom. With MainFrame you can also visit websites that you normally wouldnâ€™t be able to visit like for example discord.
__

â€˜How will I find these methods?â€™

If you want to find the latest version of MainFrame go to the website https://vacapena.ga/ on any personal device / proxy. Now it should redirect you to the pastebin, once youâ€™re there copy the URL and paste it into your chromebookâ€™s google url bar. And now you can view every method straight from your vaca-pena chromebook.
__

â€˜I canâ€™t figure out how to do this method!â€™

*If you need help utilizing our pastebin you may ping an owner or administrator about your issue, if you ping or ghost ping someone with admin permissions without reason they have permission to ban you
__

â€˜How can I suggest you something to add to MainFrame?â€™

If you want to suggest something for MainFrames paste, go to any text channel, type x!suggest <msg> and it will send your suggestion to the suggestions channel. If your suggestion gets enough upvotes we will most likely add it. Reminder, anything that isnâ€™t a real suggestion will be deleted and you will be muted / kicked.
