Also, I don't want to be caught again... So we tell everyone to use the Undetected Removal in the instructions ( https://tinyurl.com/swamp-instructions ) to gerantee we aren't caught. If we publicly tell anyone that is... you may show people but don't get too cocky now. I don't want anyone knowing how to do this or how to access this unless they were given permission by me.
