/ CROSH EXTENSION DISABLE METHOD \

How to permanently disable extensions on chromebooks using crosh
: First press ctrl + alt + t all at once to open crosh in a new tab
: Type set_cellular_ppp \';bash;exit;\' in crosh and enter
: You now have access to a bash shell, logged in as chronos
: Type rm -rf ~/Extensions/* and enter, this breaks every extension on your chromebook
: Now run the command chmod 000 ~/Extensions, this marks the extension folder as read only
: Note, this is only for chromebook versions 106 and up, if you update it won't work anymore



/ WARNING \

 I don't recommend anyone do this, but I can't really control your will. What I can do, though, is warn you. 
 Doing ANY of this will violate your school's policy and will possibly get you banned from electronics. 
 This sticks to your record, and you won't get rid of it. Think about it, are you REALLY that desperate?
